#### Software Engineer Intern
#### May 2025 - Aug 2024

After a year working in low-level firmware engineering, I
deliberately sought out a change of pace: a smaller company, a different kind
of stack, and the chance to grow as a product-minded software engineer. That
brought me to Invinity Energy Systems, where I joined the software team
responsible for controlling and monitoring industrial-scale vanadium flow
batteries.

At Invinity, I didn’t just build what I was assigned—I actively looked for
friction points, proposed improvements, and took the lead in implementing them.
A key example: I recognized that the core front-end application suffered from
high load times and poor maintainability. I took initiative, pitched a full
migration to React, and was trusted to lead the team through it. The result was
a drastically faster and cleaner codebase that reduced initial load times by
50% and improved overall usability.

Beyond UI performance, I engineered a hierarchical alerting system to help
operators rapidly detect and resolve faults across distributed battery
installations. I designed and implemented the feature end-to-end, ensuring it
was scalable, intuitive, and easy to maintain.

Security was another area where I saw opportunity. I designed and deployed a
token-based access control system for internal tooling—handling token
generation, certification, and expiry in a secure and efficient manner using
Express.js and TypeScript. This significantly improved access security while
maintaining a smooth user experience.

What made this experience especially rewarding was the scope of ownership I
had. I wasn't just writing code—I was leading technical discussions, making
architectural decisions, and helping shape product direction. I was trusted to
drive important features from concept to deployment, and the team leaned on me
to solve complex problems quickly and cleanly.

Key accomplishments:
- Identified a critical performance bottleneck and led a full-stack migration to React, halving load times.
- Designed and implemented a scalable alert system for fault visibility across distributed deployments.
- Created a secure access control layer with token lifecycle management to prevent unauthorized access.
- Reduced CI pipeline runtime by 90% through intelligent caching strategies.
- Played a critical, leadership-level role in design and implementation decisions far beyond a traditional internship.

At Invinity, I proved to myself that I can lead initiatives, deliver meaningful
systems, and contribute beyond my years of experience. It taught me how to
think not just like an engineer, but like an architect and collaborator—someone
who solves real problems and ships robust solutions.
