UBC Orbit is my university’s satellite design team: a multidisciplinary group
of over 50 students working to design, build, and launch functioning
satellites. Our current mission is **ALEASAT**, an Earth-observation CubeSat
designed to aid radio amateurs in disaster relief by enabling on-demand image
capture of specific locations on Earth. Unlike conventional Earth-observing
satellites that passively collect data, ALEASAT empowers users to actively
request and downlink imagery—making it a powerful tool for real-time disaster
monitoring.

As a firmware developer on the Command and Data handling team, I had the
opportunity to work at the intersection of software and hardware, where every
line of code must be precise, efficient, and battle-tested for the unforgiving
conditions of space. I implemented a driver in C for the MR25H40 MRAM chip
over MibSPI, enabling reliable non-volatile data storage onboard the satellite.
I also built a Dockerized CI/CD pipeline for our Command and Control
software to ensure smooth, platform-agnostic development for our diverse team.

What made this experience especially rewarding wasn’t just the technical
depth—it was the environment. Orbit gave me the space to propose solutions,
approach problems from multiple system-level perspectives, and collaborate
closely with brilliant peers from a wide range of disciplines. I had the chance
to lead development efforts, but also to mentor newer member*, help grow the
team’s knowledge base, and refine my ability to communicate and reason through
complex decisions in a collaborative setting.

Working on a real satellite, with real stakes, taught me what it means to be
accountable for the systems I help design. It demanded rigor, creativity, and
humility—and it gave back experience, confidence, and friendships.

ALEASAT is currently being developed in collaboration with the Simon Fraser
University Satellite Design Team, with support from the European Space
Agency’s Fly Your Satellite! program, Radio Amateurs of Canada, and
UBC. When it launches, it will carry not just our hardware, but the vision
of dozens of students—proving what’s possible when you dare to venture into
the unknown.
