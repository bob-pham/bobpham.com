InsightUBC is a full stack web-app, that is the default project of UBC's CPSC
310 class. Within the InsightUBC project, we created a REST backend that was
able to accept .zip's of JSON and HTM files for classroom and building
information respectively, and allow users to query the parsed results.

#### Development + Implementation

---

Within course constraints, my focus revolved around parsing and managing data
from input .zip files. I utilized JSZip, FS-extra, and parse5 libraries,
crafting a tailored data structure resembling a basic DBMS for efficient data
storage and simplified queries. Please note that specific implementation
details are restricted by course policies. In addition to these core tasks, I
spearheaded the development of a practical Mocha/Chai testing suite.
Furthermore, I built API endpoints using Express.js and designed React.js +
Material UI frontend pages for user-friendly data querying. This hands-on
approach demonstrates my versatility in both backend and frontend development,
showcasing an ability to deliver effective solutions within defined parameters.
