Finding Barrel OS is a microkernel-based operating system designed around a capability-based security model, ensuring fine-grained access control and isolation between processes. Working on this project gave me deep insights into low-level systems programming, memory management, and secure OS design. I gained hands-on experience with kernel development, IPC mechanisms, and designing a minimal yet extensible architecture. This project significantly strengthened my understanding of OS fundamentals and security principles.
