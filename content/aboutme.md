# About Me

Hey, I'm Bob and I'm a software engineer with a passion for building reliable,
high-performance systems—whether they're running close to the metal or powering
modern applications. I’m especially interested in security, high-performance
computing, cloud networking, and systems that demand both precision and
creativity.

My background spans everything from low-level protocols and drivers to
full-stack development and GPU-accelerated tools. I love digging into complex
problems, writing clear and efficient code, and constantly pushing myself to
learn something new.

Outside of work, you’ll find me snowboarding, hiking, messing with Minecraft
redstone contraptions, or climbing the StarCraft II ladder. I’m always chasing
mastery—whether in code, competition, or life.
